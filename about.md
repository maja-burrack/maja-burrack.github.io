# Get to know me
#### What I do
I work as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer! My focus is prescriptive analytics and point estimation 👩🏼‍💻.

I program in Python and build machine learning pipelines mostly in PySpark, so I can utilise the benefits of distributed cloud computing.

#### Where I am
I live in Copenhagen, Denmark 🇩🇰 

#### How I got here
As a child, I used to sit and multiply 20 digit numbers with 20 digits numbers with pen and paper. Naturally, I decided to study mathematics at university despite not knowing what kind of job it might lead to.

I opted for some adventure after high school and decided to move abroad to obtain a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Manchester in the UK. After that, I followed it up with a Master's degree from Copenhagen University, because I didn't want to miss out on the "study in Copenhagen"-experience. 

I never wanted to program computers, until I was tasked with some clustering and forecasting tasks in my first job out of uni and quickly discovered that Excel didn't excel in this. I fell down the rabbit hole and realized that in order to apply some really cool mathematics to the real world, I would have to program! Easy-peasy lemon-squeezy 🍋 

I was raised by supportive parents, one of which loved drilling multiplication tables at the dinner table (when he wasn't talking about his sporting goods store), while the other made sure the "hobby room" was always stocked with everything you could possibly want for painting, drawing, sewing and crafting. My interests spanned far then and I hope that I can cultivate the same kind of breadth today, even as I pursue depth in my work.
