# You made it! Welcome!

**I'm Maja, a Copenhagen-based Data Scientist focusing on predictive analytics and machine learning.**

**These days, I model some cool things for [Tembi](https://tembi.io)'s data platform.**

When I am not deep in data at work, you'll usually find me in a Pilates reformer class or winding down in the company of friends or a good book (and sometimes wine 🍷).

I'm also into:

- Travelling to far-off places 🌍 I particularly enjoy Asian metropolises and I usually travel alone.
- Bouldering 💪🏻 I've been doing this regularly since April 2024.
- Digital minimalism. You won't find me Instagramming nor sharing status updates on Facebook. But I won't mind if you do 😇
